camSite BUGS
----------
1. Camera already found routine
	Currently checks length of array recoeved against length of old array.
	If a camera were to drop out and a new one connected in the same search it would not be added.

	FIXED: 
		used node underscore uniq function when adding cameras

2. Info & Capabilities display
	Routine to get object within object not displaying all info
